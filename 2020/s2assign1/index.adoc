= Year 10 IST - Assignment One

*Weight:* 35% +
*Due:* Tuesday 8 September 2020 (Week 8) by 8:45am

== Changelog

This assignment was last updated on *Saturday 15 August 2020*.

If any changes are made to the assignment they will be itemised here for ease of identification.

* *UPDATE 15 AUGUST 2020:* Your first initial training of the model (using the default reward function) does *not* count towards your six trainings.

* *UPDATE 10 AUGUST 2020:* The due date of the assignment has been extended to Tuesday 8 September 2020 (8:45am) since we are going through the coursework a bit slower than expected due to our preparation for, and participation in, the CyberTaipan competition.

* *UPDATE 3 AUGUST 2020:* Some students have asked whether you can use a custom action space. *For this assignment you must use the default action space provided by the default DeepRacer vehicle in the garage.* This is to keep the model as general as possible and avoid incorporating environment-specific knowledge of the reInvent:2018 track, along with keeping the scope of this first assignment reasonably narrow. In the next assignment you will have the opportunity to modify the action space if needed.

== Task Context

== Task Requirements

In class you have been introduced to the basics of training a machine learning model to autonomously drive the AWS DeepRacer around a simulated and real-world race track. In this assignment you will continue to further develop your model through tuning of the reward function, together with exploring the various parameters and hyperparameters available to help with this process of refinement.

The deliverable for this assignment is a trained model along with a report explaining the process.

You are *not* being marked on the reliability or speed of the model, but you are instead being marked on the process and decisions you made during the training process. That said, if your model is highly unreliable or unstable then there's likely something wrong with your training approach, which will obviously cost you marks.

*Even though you are not being marked on reliability or speed, the goal is to get the car around the track as reliability and fast as possible* - and this should be your ultimate goal when tuning and refining the way you train the model. However, we didn't want to make your mark dependent on this aspect as there is a degree of entropy involved in machine learning training...so we still want to reward you if you did all the right things to train the model well, but (due to luck) the training itself didn't pan out (but it likely would if you were not subject to the training time limits imposed for this assignment).

During class you have implemented the basic (default) reward function provided by the AWS DeepRacer console. Subsequently, in https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud014/lessons/0afdbee8-cf7a-4966-b8ed-f860f3d68cb6/concepts/e54b4097-d5f4-4bf5-bcfd-288ff80ead34[Lesson 5 (Chapters 15 and 16)] this was further tuned through using the advanced reward function followed by modifying hyperparameters. In this assignment you must start by using either the basic or advanced reward function as a basis, training on the reInvent:2018 track.

1. You should create a new model, using the unmodified basic or advanced reward function and the default hyperparameter values, run on the regular (non-wide) re:Invent 2018 track. The model should then be trained for 1 hour. This will provide you with a baseline model.

2. Simulate the model at least three times (three test runs per simulation = nine test runs total) and report on the results. This may include analysis of the reward function and success rate of the model when simulated on the track.

3. You should then clone the model and start your process of refinement and tuning, changing one thing at a time (such as parameters or hyperparameters). At this stage you can start rewriting/modifying/adapting the reward function as you see fit. However, you *must* be able to justify your decisions as you must report on everything in your written report. This should include code excerpts, possibly code annotations, etc. along with why you those certain decisions, referencing any sources as needed (e.g. the DeepRacer developer guide).

4. After you have finished the first iteration then put the model into training for 1 hour, simulate the model at least three times, and report on the results.

5. Repeat this process to continue tuning your model another five times (so you have done a total of six rounds of training, *not* including the initial round on the default reward function - *this was updated on 15 August*).

6. Report on the final results, along with providing a copy of your final reward function. There is no need to provide a copy of your model, as we will load these onto the vehicle in class after the assignment is due for real-world testing.

[NOTE]
====
*For equity, you can only train your model six times total (not including the default training run), each time for 1 hour.* This is to avoid a situation where some students might pay for additional training time themselves which provides them with an advantage over other students.

=== Report Formatting

A few words on formatting of the reports, based upon submissions from last semester. Your report should be professionally presented with all of the following:

* Title page
* Automatically generated table of contents
* Automatic page numbering in the footer
* Page breaks where appropriate
* Use heading styles (this will assist in the generation of a table of contents)

You should also be careful with your placement of images, to ensure that they are readable and also do not look out of place with the text. This might necessitate the need for changes to the position of text or using page breaks. Also, make sure you look at the document and its overall layout to ensure it looks professional. This may involve things such as wrapping text around smaller images where appropriate, using fully justified text to fill the entire width of the document, etc.

== Submission Instructions

This assignment is worth 35% of your Semester One assessment for this subject.

A blank Google Doc template will be provided in Google Classroom in which you can complete the assignment. When you are ready to submit, click the *TURN IN* button.

*Late submissions will incur penalties as per the school assessment policy:* For assignments and non-test events a late work penalty of 10% of the total possible mark will be incurred for each day late if work is not submitted on the due date.  A loss of 30% is incurred if work due on a Friday is not submitted until the following Monday. After one week (7 days) the item will be awarded a mark of zero.

=== Draft Submissions

You may optionally (but strongly encouraged) submit one draft of your assignment for review prior to formal submission. Your draft must be feature complete (i.e. not a half-done assignment) and submitted at least one week before the assignment due date - for this assignment, drafts are due by 8:45am on Tueday 1 September 2020). To submit a draft, just submit your Google Classroom assignment as you would for the real submission. I will then review your draft, with comments within Google Classroom, and then return the assignment so you can make any necessary corrections. You can then submit the assignment again for your real submission.

You are also welcome to ask me as you're working on the assignment whether it's on the right track with the correct level of detail.
